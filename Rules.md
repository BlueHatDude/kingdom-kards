# Kingdom Kards Rules

## General
Each player has their own deck of 52 standard playing cards. At the start of the
game, each player will draw five cards from their deck. These cards are the 
starting hand. Each player also starts with 100 points. If a player's points
reach zero at any point, then that player will be eliminated.

The turn player can play as many cards as they have cards in their hand. There 
are six types of cards a player can use during their turn: King, Queen, Jack,
Number, Red Ace, and Black Ace. When a card is "played" or "used", the turn 
player must put that card from their hand into their Discard Pile, alongside
any cards that are attached to it. 

If a player attempts to draw a card, but they don't have enough cards in their
deck to do so, then their discard pile will be shuffled with the rest of their 
deck to create a new deck before they draw their cards. 

## Card Effects
Kings can be played either by themselves or with a number attached. If a King
is played by itself, then it will subtract 10 from the points of whatever player
the turn player chooses. If there is a number attached, then the King will deal
10 plus the value of that number. For example, a King attached with a 5 will 
subtract 15 points from another player instead of 10. 

Queens can be played either by themselves or with a number attached. If a Queen 
is plyaed by itself, then it will add 10 points to the player who activated it. 
If there is a number attached, the the QUeen will add 10 plus the value of that
number. For example, if a Queen is attached with a 6, then it will add 16 points
instead of ten. 

Jacks can only be played in response to a King, Queen, a Red Ace. When a Jack
is played, it negates the last card that was played. For example, if a Jack is
played on top of a King+8, then the player will take zero damage. If a Jack is
played in response to a Queen, then the player that activated the Queen will
gain no points.

Number cards can only be played by themselves. When a Number card is used, the
turn player must discard cards equal to the value of that Number, then draw
cards equal the value of that Number. For  example, if a 2 is played, then the
player must discard 2 cards from their hand, then draw 2 cards. 

Black Aces can only be played by themselves. When a Black Ace is used, the turn
player can add any card from their discard pile back into their hand, except 
another Black Ace. 

Red Aces can only be played in response to Kings and Queens. When a Red Ace is
played, it allows the player that used it to redirect the effect of the King
or Queen it was played in response to. For example, if the King+4 is played,
then 14 will be subtracted from another player's points. If a Queen+2
is played, then 12 points will be added to another player's points.
